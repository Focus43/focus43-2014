                        <p>Want to know what's really fun for a development team? Scratching your own itch. As residents ourselves of lovely Jackson, WY, F43 had used the Town Of Jackson's previous website frequently. Even more frequently we said "man, we could do this better". We got the chance.</p>

                        <p>On its seventh year when F43 was approached, the Town Of Jackson's website was long in the tooth, ineffectively serving the myriad audiences of a municipal website. F43 was challenged to provide discovery, planning, design and implementation of a completely new, mobile-first site, built from the ground up.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>The Town of Jackson wanted a contemporary site design and told us it needed to be mobile friendly. The new design had to represent the quality and service level Jackson has to offer — a look and functionality on par with other premier resort destinations municipalities.</p>
                <p>But, before we jumped into cranking out eye candy, we spent time analyzing the old site’s traffic. Right away we identified visitor engagement erosion that neatly correlated with the site’s growth in mobile visits. Mobile visitors were more important and growing faster than we originally suspected.</p>
                <p>With that in mind, Focus43 delivered a responsive, mobile-first design that presented critical content navigation buttons for small screens and expanded content as a visitor’s screen allowed.</p>
